```{r}
health_df <- read.csv(path)
nrow(health_df)
ncol(health_df)
```
Our dataset contains **108252 observations** and **50 variables**.  
The first 5 observations of the dataset:
```{r}
head(health_df, 5)
```


```{r}
summary(health_df)
```



# Data encoding and visualization

## **TARGET**
- **Mood_disorder**:
This is our target variable. It indicates whether a person has a mood disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania or dysthymia.  
Documentation: 1 =Yes, 2 = No, 7 = Donâ€™t know, 8 = Refusal.  
I'll treat '7' and '8' as NaN.  
Since it's a categorical variable, I have to transform it into a **factor**.
```{r}
health_df$Mood_disorder <- factor(health_df$Mood_disorder,
                                  levels = c(2, 1),
                                  labels = c("No", "Yes"))

summary(health_df$Mood_disorder)
```


```{r}
ggplot(health_df, aes(x = Mood_disorder, fill = Mood_disorder)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent((..count..)/sum(..count..)),
                y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)),
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Mood Disorder",
       x = "Mood Disorder Status",
       y = "Count of Individuals") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_minimal() +

  scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "purple", "Yes" = "orange"))
```


This is an auxiliar funtion that plots the distribution of Mood_disorder with respect to the other variables in the dataset.
```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution <- function(data, varname, var_labels) {
  data[[varname]] <- factor(data[[varname]])
  ggplot(data, aes_string(x = varname, fill = "factor(Mood_disorder)")) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
    labs(x = varname, y = "Count", fill = "Mood Disorder") +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = var_labels) +
    scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("0" = "Yes", "1" = "No"))
}
```

---------------------------------------------

Now, I'll start to look deeper at each other variable present in the dataset.  
Mostly are categorical variable, so I'll transform them into a **factor** as well.  

## Demographic Information

- ADM_RNO1: This column is stated as "not encoded". It's a unique identifier and doesn't carry meaning, so I'll exclude it from my logistic regression model. 

- Province: The documentation says that the coding of this column "does not add any deeper insights into the data". So I'll exclude it.

- Health_region_grouped: This variable represents health regions. Given the large number of regions, I might need to group them further or exclude this variable to avoid too many dimensions. I'll first train the model without it, then I'll take in consideration the one-hot-encoding to see if it improves the model.

```{r}
health_df = subset(health_df, select = -c(ADM_RNO1, Province, Health_region_.grouped))
```


- Gender: 
Documentation: 1 = Male, 2 = Female, 9 = Not stated.
  
```{r}
gender_labels <- c("1" = "Male", "2" = "Female", "9" = "Not stated")
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Gender", var_labels = gender_labels)
```

Values '9' are not present.

```{r}
health_df$Gender <- factor(health_df$Gender,
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Male", "Female"))
summary(health_df$Gender)
```

- Marital_status:
Documentation: 1 = Married/Common-law, 2 = Widowed/Divorced/Separated/Single, 3 = Valid skip, 9 = Not stated.  
I'll treat 9 as NaN.

```{r}
Marital_status_labels <- c("1" = "Married", "2" = "Single", "6" = "Valid skip", "9" = "Not stated")
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Marital_status", var_labels = Marital_status_labels)
```

The code '6' is not reported in the documentation for this category. However, many of other variables take the value '6' if is reported a 'valid skip'. Thus, i'll treat the '6' as 'valid skip' also for this category.  
  
```{r}
health_df$Marital_status[health_df$Marital_status %in% c(6, 9)] <- NA

health_df$Marital_status <- factor(health_df$Marital_status,
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Married", "Single"))


summary(health_df$Marital_status)
```

- Household:
Documentation: 1 = Lives alone, 2 = Household size 2 or more, 9 = Not stated.  
As per Martial_status, I'll treat '9' as NaN.
  
```{r}
Household_labels <- c("1" = "Live Alone", "2" = "Household", "9" = "Not stated")
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Household", var_labels = Household_labels)
```


```{r}
health_df$Household[health_df$Household %in% c(9)] <- NA

health_df$Household <- factor(health_df$Household,
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Live Alone", "Household"))
summary(health_df$Household)
```

- Age:
Documentation: 1 = 12 to 17 years, 2 = 18 to 34 years, 3 = 35 to 49 years, 4 = 50 to 64 years, 5 = 65 and older.

```{r}
Age_labels <- c("1" = "12-17 yr", "2" = "18-34 yr", "3" = "35-49 yr", "4" = "50-64 yr", "5" = "65+")
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Age", var_labels = Age_labels)
```


```{r}
health_df$Age <- factor(health_df$Age,
                                  levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                                  labels = c("12-17 yr", "18-34 yr", "35-49 yr", "50-64 yr", "65+"))
summary(health_df$Age)
```

- Aboriginal_identity:
Indicates whether the respondent identifies as an Aboriginal person, specifically belonging to one of the following groups: First Nations (including both Status and Non-Status Indians), MÃ©tis, or Inuk (Inuit).  
Documentation: 1 = Yes, 2 = No, 7 = Don't know, 8 = Refusal, 9 = Not stated.
```{r}
Aboriginal_identity_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Yes", "2" = "No", "7" = "Don't know", "8" = "Refusal", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Aboriginal_identity", var_labels = Aboriginal_identity_labels )
```

```{r}
health_df$Aboriginal_identity[health_df$Aboriginal_identity %in% c(7, 8, 9)] <- NA

health_df$Aboriginal_identity <- factor(health_df$Aboriginal_identity,
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Yes", "No"))
summary(health_df$Aboriginal_identity)
```

- Birth_country:
This says if a person was born in Canada or elsewhere.
```{r}
Birth_country_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Canada", "2" = "Other", "3" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Birth_country", var_labels = Birth_country_labels )
```

```{r}
health_df$Birth_country[health_df$Birth_country %in% c(9)] <- NA

health_df$Birth_country <- factor(health_df$Birth_country,
  levels = c(1, 2),
  labels = c("Canada", "Other")
)
summary(health_df$Birth_country)
```


- Immigrant:
Whether someone is an immigrant or not.
```{r}
Immigrant_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Immigrant", "2" = "Non-immigrant", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Immigrant", var_labels = Immigrant_labels )
```

```{r}
health_df$Immigrant[health_df$Immigrant %in% c(9)] <- NA

health_df$Immigrant <- factor(health_df$Immigrant,
                        levels = c(1, 2),
                        labels = c("Immigrant", "Non-immigrant"))

summary(health_df$Immigrant)
```


## Socioeconomic Status

- Worked_job_business:
Indicates whether the respondent has worked at a job or business at any time during the past 12 months.  
Documentation: 1 = Yes, 2 = No, 6 = Valid skip, 7 = Donâ€™t know, 8 = Refusal, 9 = Not stated.

```{r}
Worked_job_business_labels <- c("1" = "Yes", "2" = "No", "6" = "Valid skip", "7" = "Don't know", "8" = "Refusal", "9" = "Not stated")
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Worked_job_business", var_labels = Worked_job_business_labels)
```

I'll treat 7 ("Don't know"), 8 ("Refusal"), and 9 ("Not stated") as NaN.  

There are lots of mood_disorder's values in "Valid skip". However, since it should not be a relevant answer, and considering that these values referred to people that has answered to other questions in a more relevant way, I'll discard these values by setting them to NaN. 

```{r}
health_df$Worked_job_business[health_df$Worked_job_business %in% c(6, 7, 8, 9)] <- NA

health_df$Worked_job_business <- factor(health_df$Worked_job_business,
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Did work", "Didn't work"))
summary(health_df$Worked_job_business)
```

- Edu_level:
Documentation: 1 = Less than secondary school, 2 = Secondary school, 3 = Post-secondary, 9 = Not stated.
  
```{r}
Edu_level_labels <- c("1" = "<secondary school", "2" = "Secondary school", "3" = "Post-secondary", "9" = "Not stated")
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Edu_level", var_labels = Edu_level_labels)
```

Here I'll treat '9' as NaN as well.

```{r}
health_df$Edu_level[health_df$Edu_level == 9] <- NA

health_df$Edu_level <- factor(health_df$Edu_level,
                                  levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                                  labels = c("<secondary school", "Secondary school", "Post-secondary"))

```


- working_status:
For this the respondents are of age 18 to 64.  
This says if a person works full-time / part-time (for total usual hours).
```{r}

)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "working_status", var_labels = working_status_labels )
```

```{r}
health_df$working_status[health_df$working_status %in% c(6, 9)] <- NA

health_df$working_status <- factor(health_df$working_status,
  levels = c(1, 2),

```

```{r}
health_df$Insurance_cover[health_df$Insurance_cover %in% c(9)] <- NA

health_df$Insurance_cover <- factor(health_df$Insurance_cover,
                        levels = c(1, 2),
                        labels = c("Yes", "No"))

)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Food_security", var_labels = Food_security_labels)
```

```{r}
health_df$Food_security[health_df$Food_security %in% c(6,9)] <- NA

## Lifestyle & Behaviors

- Life_satisfaction:
It indicates the satisfaction with life in general, measured on a scale from 0 to 10.
```{r}

hist(health_df$Life_satisfaction, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
health_df$Life_satisfaction_ord <- factor(health_df$Life_satisfaction, ordered = TRUE)
```
I'll treat this as an ordinal variable because it represents a discrete satisfaction scale ranging from 0 to 10, where the order of values reflects increasing levels of satisfaction.
```{r}
health_df$Life_satisfaction_ord <- factor(health_df$Life_satisfaction, ordered = TRUE)
```

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Sense_belonging", var_labels = Sense_belonging_labels)
```

```{r}

health_df$Sense_belonging <- factor(health_df$Sense_belonging,
  levels = 1:4,
  labels = c("Very strong", "~strong", "~weak", "Very weak"))
```
 

- Act_improve_health:
Indicates whether the respondent took any actions to improve their health in the past 12 months.
```{r}
Act_improve_health_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Yes", "2" = "No", "6" = "Valid skip", "7" = "Don't know", "8" = "Refusal"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Act_improve_health", var_labels = Act_improve_health_labels)
```

```{r}

health_df$Act_improve_health <- factor(health_df$Act_improve_health,
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Yes", "No"))

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Act_improve_health", var_labels = Act_improve_health_labels)

- Fruit_veg_con:
Grouping of total daily consumption of fruits and vegetables.
```{r}
Fruit_veg_con_labels <- c(
  "1" = "<5/day", "2" = "5-10/day", "3" = ">10/day",
  "6" = "Valid skip", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Fruit_veg_con", var_labels = Fruit_veg_con_labels)
```
  
The possible values reported in the documentation are:  
- "1": Less than 5 times a day  
- "2": 5-10 times a day  
- "3": More than 10 times a day  
As we can see in the above plot, the values are not coded.   
I will assume that the values are just the answer given to the question: How much fruits and vegetables do you consume daily?  
Thus, I'll map each value to the right category:  

```{r}
# fruit_veg_con has continuous values, so first I'll discretisize them
health_df$Fruit_veg_con <- cut(health_df$Fruit_veg_con,
                        breaks = c(-Inf, 5, 10, Inf),
                        labels = c(1, 2, 3),
                        right = FALSE)

# Converto in factor per chiarezza (opzionale ma consigliato)
health_df$Fruit_veg_con <- factor(health_df$Fruit_veg_con,
                           levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                           labels = c("Less than 5/day", "5-10/day", "More than 10/day"))

summary(health_df$Fruit_veg_con)
```
```{r}
Fruit_veg_con_labels <- c(
  "1" = "<5/day", "2" = "5-10/day", "3" = ">10/day",
  "6" = "Valid skip", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Fruit_veg_con", var_labels = Fruit_veg_con_labels)
```


- Smoked:
Number of cigarettes smoked daily by the respondent (daily smoker).
```{r}
Smoked_labels <- c(
  "996" = "Valid skip", "997" = "Don't know", "998" = "Refusal", "999" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Smoked", var_labels = Smoked_labels)
```
Here, the values are correctly reported as in the documentation. 

```{r}
health_df$Smoked <- ifelse(health_df$Smoked %in% c(996, 997, 998, 999), 0, health_df$Smoked)

```

```{r}
hist(health_df$Smoked, breaks = 30, main = "Daily distribution of cigarettes", xlab = "Cigarettes per day")

```
We assume that those who reported "Valid skip", "Don't know", "Refusal", "Not stated" are simply "Non smoker".
```{r}
health_df$Smoked[is.na(health_df$Smoked)] <- 0
health_df$Smoked <- cut(health_df$Smoked,
                     breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, Inf),
                     labels = c("Non smoker", "1-5/day", "6-10/day", "11-20/day", "21-30/day", ">30/day"),
                     right = TRUE)

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Smoked", var_labels = Smoked_labels)
```



- Tobaco_use:
Use of alternative tobacco products such as chewing tobacco, pinch, or snuff within the last 30 days.

  "8" = "Refusal", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Tobaco_use", var_labels = Tobaco_use_labels)
```

```{r}
health_df$Tobaco_use <- ifelse(health_df$Tobaco_use == 1, 0,
                        ifelse(health_df$Tobaco_use == 2, 1, NA))
health_df$Tobaco_use <- factor(health_df$Tobaco_use, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Smoker", "Non-Smoker"))

summary(health_df$Tobaco_use)
```


- weekly_alcohol:
Indicates whether the respondent has consumed any alcoholic beverage in the past 12 months.
```{r}
weekly_alcohol_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Yes", "2" = "No", "6" = "Valid skip", "7" = "Don't know",
  "8" = "Refusal", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "weekly_alcohol", var_labels = weekly_alcohol_labels )
```
Here, again, we have raw values as in fruit_veg_con.  
The documentation simply says that this variable should tell if someone either drink or not.

```{r}
health_df$weekly_alcohol <- cut(
  health_df$weekly_alcohol,
  breaks = c(-Inf, 0, Inf),
  labels = c("Non drinker", "Drinks"),
  right = TRUE

)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Cannabies_use", var_labels = Cannabies_use_labels )
```

```{r}
health_df$Cannabies_use[health_df$Cannabies_use %in% c(6, 7, 8, 9)] <- NA

health_df$Cannabies_use <- factor(health_df$Cannabies_use,

summary(health_df$Cannabies_use)
```

)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Drug_use", var_labels = Drug_use_labels )
```

```{r}
health_df$Drug_use <- ifelse(health_df$Drug_use == 1, 0,
                        ifelse(health_df$Drug_use == 2, 1, NA))
health_df$Drug_use <- factor(health_df$Drug_use, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Drug user", "Non-user"))

summary(health_df$Drug_use)
```
 
 
## Physical Activity & Body Metrics

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Weight_state", var_labels = Weight_state_labels)
```

```{r}
health_df$Weight_state[health_df$Weight_state %in% c(6, 7, 8, 9)] <- NA

health_df$Weight_state <- factor(health_df$Weight_state,
  levels = c(1, 2, 3),
  labels = c("Overweight", "Underweight", "Just about right")
)
summary(health_df$Weight_state)
```

  "6" = "Valid skip", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "BMI_12_17", var_labels = BMI_12_17_labels)
```

```{r}
health_df$BMI_12_17[health_df$BMI_12_17 %in% c(6, 9)] <- NA

health_df$BMI_12_17 <- factor(health_df$BMI_12_17,
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Thinness", "Overweight"))

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "BMI_12_17", var_labels = BMI_12_17_labels)
```


- BMI_18_above:
Body Mass Index (BMI) for individuals aged 18+, self-reported. 
```{r}
BMI_18_above_labels <- c(

  "6" = "Valid skip", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "BMI_18_above", var_labels = BMI_18_above_labels)
```


```{r}
health_df$BMI_18_above[health_df$BMI_18_above %in% c(6, 9)] <- NA

health_df$BMI_18_above <- factor(health_df$BMI_18_above,

- Total_active_time:
Represents the total number of hours spent in active transportation over the past 7 days, considering only those lasting at least 10 minutes at a time.

  "99996" = "Valid skip", "99997" = "Don't know", "99999898" = "Refusal", "99999" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Total_active_time", var_labels = Total_active_time_labels )
```

For this variable, the unit value is minutes. The documentation says that it should be hours, but I'll keep them as minutes so I can classify them by the WHO guidelines.

```{r}
health_df$Total_active_time <- ifelse(health_df$Total_active_time %in% c(99996, 99997, 99998, 99999),
                                       NA,
                                       health_df$Total_active_time)
health_df$Total_active_time <- health_df$Total_active_time 
summary(health_df$Total_active_time)
```

```{r}
hist(health_df$Total_active_time, breaks = 30, main = "Daily distribution of active time", xlab = "Active time", na.rm = TRUE)
```
Levels are classified according to WHO guidelines:  
- Inactive: 0 minutes  
- Insufficiently active: 1â€“149 minutes   
- Sufficiently active: 150+ minutes  
```{r}
health_df$Total_active_time <- cut(health_df$Total_active_time,
                             breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 149, Inf),
                             labels = c("Inactive", "Insufficiently active", "Sufficiently active"),
                             right = TRUE)

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Total_active_time", var_labels = Total_active_time_labels )
```


- Total_physical_act_time:
Represents the total time (in the past 7 days) the respondent spent on sports, fitness, or recreational physical activitiesâ€”organized or non-organizedâ€”that lasted at least 10 continuous minutes per session (i.e. walking, home or gym exercise, swimming, cycling, running, skiing, dancing and all team sports).
```{r}
Total_physical_act_time_labels <- c(
  "99996" = "Valid skip", "99997" = "Don't know", "99999898" = "Refusal", "99999" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Total_physical_act_time", var_labels = Total_physical_act_time_labels )
```
```{r}
table(health_df$Total_physical_act_time)
```

These are raw data. Thus, I'll convert Total_physical_act_time from 10-minute units to total minutes and then classify the levels according to WHO guidelines.
```{r}
health_df$Total_physical_act_time <- ifelse(health_df$Total_physical_act_time %in% c(9996, 9997, 9998, 9999),
                                             NA,
                                             health_df$Total_physical_act_time)
health_df$Total_physical_act_time <- health_df$Total_physical_act_time

health_df$Total_physical_act_time <- cut(health_df$Total_physical_act_time,
                                       breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 149, Inf),
                                       labels = c("Inactive", "Insufficiently active", "Sufficiently active"),
                                       right = TRUE)

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Total_physical_act_time", var_labels = Total_physical_act_time_labels )
```


- Other_physical_act_time:

```{r}
Other_physical_act_time_labels <- c(
  "99996" = "Valid skip", "99997" = "Don't know", "99998" = "Refusal", "99999" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Other_physical_act_time", var_labels = Other_physical_act_time_labels )
```

```{r}
table(health_df$Other_physical_act_time)
```

The unit value for Other_physical_act_time has not been reported in the documentation.  
Thus, I'll assume that the values are expressed in minutes and proceed as I did for the previous variables.

```{r}
health_df$Other_physical_act_time <- ifelse(health_df$Other_physical_act_time %in% c(99996, 99998, 99999),
                                             NA,
                                             health_df$Other_physical_act_time)
health_df$Other_physical_act_time <- health_df$Other_physical_act_time 

health_df$Other_physical_act_time <- cut(health_df$Other_physical_act_time,
                                       breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 149, Inf),
                                       labels = c("Inactive", "Insufficiently active", "Sufficiently active"),
                                       right = TRUE)

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Other_physical_act_time", var_labels = Other_physical_act_time_labels )
```



- Physical_vigorous_act_time:
Represents the total number of minutes over the past 7 days that the respondent spent doing vigorous-intensity physical activitiesâ€”those that cause heavy breathing or being out of breath.
```{r}
Physical_vigorous_act_time_labels <- c(
  "99996" = "Valid skip", "99997" = "Don't know", "99999898" = "Refusal", "99999" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Physical_vigorous_act_time", var_labels = Physical_vigorous_act_time_labels )
```
```{r}
table(health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time)
```


Again, here I'll classify the levels according to WHO guidelines. 
```{r}
health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time <- ifelse(health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time %in% c(99996, 99998, 99999),
                                             NA,
                                             health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time)
health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time <- health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time 

health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time <- cut(health_df$Physical_vigorous_act_time,
                                       breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 149, Inf),
                                       labels = c("Inactive", "Insufficiently active", "Sufficiently active"),
                                       right = TRUE)

plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Physical_vigorous_act_time", var_labels = Physical_vigorous_act_time_labels )
```


- Work_hours:
It indicates the total usual hours worked per week.
```{r}
Work_hours_labels <- c(
  "96" = "Valid skip","99" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Work_hours", var_labels = Work_hours_labels )
```
```{r}
health_df$Work_hours <- ifelse(health_df$Work_hours %in% c(96, 99),
                                NA,
                                health_df$Work_hours)

```

```{r}
hist(health_df$Work_hours, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Standardize Work_hours (mean=0, sd=1)
health_df$Work_hours <- scale(health_df$Work_hours)
hist(health_df$Work_hours, na.rm = TRUE)

```



## Health Outcomes & Utilities

- Health_utility_indx:
 Indicates the respondentâ€™s overall health-related quality of life, measured using the Health Utilities Index (HUI).
```{r}
Health_utility_indx_labels <- c(
  "1" = "HUI < 0.8", "2" = "HUI >= 0.8", "9" = "Not stated"
)
plot_Mood_disorder_distribution(health_df, "Health_utility_indx", var_labels = Health_utility_indx_labels)
```

```{r}
health_df$Health_utility_indx[health_df$Health_utility_indx %in% c(9)] <- NA

health_df$Health_utility_indx <- factor(health_df$Health_utility_indx,
  levels = c(1, 2),
  labels = c("HUI<0.8", "HUI>=0.8")
)
summary(health_df$Health_utility_indx)
```

# Final dataset


This is the final cleaned dataset:
```{r}
head(health_df, 5)
```



```{r}
summary(health_df) 
```


```{r}
saveRDS(health_df, path)
```
